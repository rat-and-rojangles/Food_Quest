Food Quest - Are you in the mood for food?

Welcome to Food Quest, a platform 2D game to teach children about nutrition.

Using Unity and C#, the player will go through levels by using food power-ups to traverse the map and get to the next level. 
Depending on the food's characteristics, activating the food will affect the human, from jumping high to moving fast! 
But beware, not everything that tastes good is good for you...

Though lighthearted, Food Quest teaches children about the benefits and hazards of eating specific food items and also illustrates the way in which eating them will either benefit or detriment a human being. 
With an interactive, hands-on approach, Food Quest allows children a chance to see for themselves the effect of food on their bodies, excites them to learn more about nutrition, all in a fun, engaging 2D platformer.

Fun for all ages!
